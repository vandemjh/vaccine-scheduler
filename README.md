# vaccine-scheduler
Find vaccine locations.  

My grandfather needs a covid vaccine but there is somehow no one stop shop for finding an appointment.  This tool finds appointments by [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/vaccine/intake/store/cvd-store-select/first-dose-select) by zip code.  

## Usage
`node . state`

Where:
        state is a state supported by CVS vaccine scheduling and
        sleeptime is a number of seconds to avoid being banned
